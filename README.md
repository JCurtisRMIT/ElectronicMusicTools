# Electronic Music Tools

Creative Computing projects focussed on Sound Design & Sound Synthesis: design new algorithmic patterns to generate both rhythmic (Drum Machines) and melodic music samples, code new interactive synthesizers and theremins and on top of it, build user-friendly and beautiful UIs to make the music tools available outside music environments and DAWs (web and mobile).

## Environments, Languages & Frameworks used to create this repo


### Domain Specific Languages:

- __Alda__: A music programming language for musicians, runs on Java 8+.
visit [Alda on GitHub](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda).

- __ChucK__: audio programming language for real-time synthesis, composition, and performance. It is designed to favor readability and flexibility for the programmer over other considerations such as raw performance.

- __Csound__: audio DSL, written in C, based on the earlier system called Music 11.

- __FAUST__: (Functional AUdio STream) a domain-specific purely functional programming language for implementing signal processing algorithms in the form of libraries, audio plug-ins, or standalone applications.

- __Kyma__: visual programming language with characteristics of both object-oriented and functional programming languages for sound design used by musicians, researchers, and sound designers. It programs a multiprocessor DSP by graphically connecting modules.

- __Max/MSP__: visual programming language for music and multimedia. It has been used by composers, performers, software designers, researchers, and artists to create recordings, performances, and installations.

- __MUSIC-N Languages__: have very similar model behind them to the analogue synthesis model, where unit generators (modules) would be wired together effectively and programmatically into synthesis graphs, which generates sound.

- __Pure Data (Pd)__: visual programming language for creating interactive computer music and multimedia works. 


### Front-ends, IDEs & music composition environments:

- __Bipscript__: a simple programming environment for creating music.

- __CodeCircle__ (Goldsmiths University): browser based software development environment developed by Goldsmiths University, as well as a social environment to collaborate with other coders and musicians.  
                  \[*JavaScript*]  
               
- __EarSketch__  (Georgia Tech): web-based music, composition and remix environment that comprises different elements: DAW, code editor, console and a sound browser.
(The sound library was created by Young Guru and Richard Devine)
                  \[*JavaScript, Python*]
   
- __Impromptu__: an OSX programming language and environment for composers, sound artists, VJ's and graphic artists with an interest in live or interactive programming. Impromptu is a Scheme language environment (Lisp family).

- __Reaktor__ (Native Instruments): graphical modular software music studio. It lets musicians and sound specialists design and build their own instruments, samplers, effects and sound design tools.

- __SuperCollider__: platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition, used by musicians, artists, and researchers working with sound existing out of 3 major components: scsynth, a real-time audio server; sclang, an interpreted programming language; scide, an editor for sclang.
                  

###  Music libraries, frameworks & packages:

- __Web Audio API__: powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning) and much more.

- __CLM__: (Common Lisp Music) is a music synthesis and signal processing package in the Music V family. It runs in a number of various Lisp implementations or as a part of the Snd audio editor (using Scheme, Ruby and now Forth). There is also a realtime implementation, Snd-rt.

- __JSyn__: Java audio synthesizer library with unit generators, used to generate sound effects, audio environments, or music.

- __LADSPA__: "Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API" is an API standard for handling audio filters and audio signal processing effects Framework. LADSPA exists primarily as a header file written in C.

- __VST__: software interface that integrates software audio synthesizer and effect plugins with audio editors and recording systems. VST and similar technologies use digital signal processing to simulate traditional recording studio hardware in software.
